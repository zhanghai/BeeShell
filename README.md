Java REPL on Android with [BeanShell](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell).

Useful for quickly checking some framework API behavior, or calling Java APIs with the permissions of ADB shell.

This is not an officially supported Google product.

## Built-ins

The application `Context` is available via the `context` variable in the global namespace.

An `Activity` instance is also available as `activity` when running with UI, and references to it in the global namespace will be cleared upon rotation to avoid memory leaks.

Other BeanShell built-ins are also available, though not guaranteed to work, e.g. Swing-based UI built-ins won't work on Android.

## Running in ADB shell

Execute the following command in `adb shell`:

```
pm_path=`pm path me.zhanghai.android.beeshell` && apk_path=${pm_path#package:} && `dirname $apk_path`/lib/*/libbsh.so
```

## Limitation

[BeanShell](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell) was written for running on a desktop JVM instead of Android, and as a result class-related Java syntax may be unsupported in this app. Specifically, you cannot define new classes except for anonymous inner classes implementing an existing interface.
